        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            The `PERSONAL_security_SCANNER` project aims to develop a suite of tools and scripts that allow individuals to test the security posture of their own devices and home networks. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and potential security risks, thereby enhancing personal digital safety.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Features</h2>
        <p>As a new project, PERSONAL_security_SCANNER is in its initial conceptualization. Envisioned core features include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Port Scanning:** Identifying open ports and running services on network devices.</li>
            <li>**Vulnerability Checks:** Basic scanning for common software vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li>**Configuration Audits:** Assessing common security settings for best practices.</li>
            <li>A user-friendly interface for initiating scans and viewing results.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Future of PERSONAL_security_SCANNER</h2>
        <p>The future vision for PERSONAL_security_SCANNER is to become a comprehensive, easy-to-use personal cybersecurity toolkit. Future developments may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Advanced vulnerability detection using up-to-date threat intelligence.</li>
            <li>Automated scheduling of scans and alerts for new issues.</li>
            <li>Detailed, actionable recommendations for resolving identified security problems.</li>
            <li>Support for a wider range of devices, including IoT.</li>
            <li>Strict adherence to ethical guidelines, emphasizing testing only on owned and permitted systems.</li>
